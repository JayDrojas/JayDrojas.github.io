      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Damian Rojas, I am an aspiring and passionate software developer. I love to code, the excitement I get when I have a lead when debugging is exhilarating. The rush of happiness I get when I find the solution is even better. I am also a curious person who enjoys solving problems and creating more intuitive solutions. I am a committed teammate and a patient and great communicator. A few of my favorite programming languages are JavaScript and Python. \n I am fluent in Spanish and English. I also enjoy learning programming languages and frameworks like React and Angular. Some technologies that I have used are React, JavaScript, Python, Express, Flask, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Docker. \n My hobbies are soccer, football, video gaming, and tech. I enjoy learning new things and I am eager to explore many more technologies that can help benefit me as a software engineer. I hope to one day work on artificial intelligence.",
